# Elizabeth Bennet

My favorite character in Jane Austen's most popular novel "Pride and Prejudice" is Elizabeth Bennet, the second oldest daughter of the Bennet family that is at the heart of the story. 

## Character traits

* witty (just as her dad)
* spirited
* loves reading
* very fond of her older sister
* thoughtful
* a little bit proud (otherwise, the novel's title would be misplaced...)

About Mr. Darcy, she says at the beginning:
> I could easily forgive his pride, 
> if he had not mortified mine.
